# Text Recognition Tesseract:

    Simple text recognition script to recognize text from frame when you press key "p".
    
## Requirements:
    - Tesseract
    - Pytesseract
    - OpenCV
    
## Future Improvements:
    - You can train Tesseract to recognise your hand writing but it will take weeks to train model.
    - We can use Google Vision API instead for better accuracy.
